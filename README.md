- Portal (MAIN):	http://localhost/CxWebInterface/Portal/CxWebService.asmx
- SDK:	http://localhost/CxWebInterface/SDK/CxSDKWebService.asmx
- Audit:	http://localhost/CxWebInterface/Audit/CxAuditWebService.asmx

- Sonar:	http://localhost/CxWebInterface/Sonar/CxSonarWebService.asmx
- VS:	http://localhost/CxWebInterface/VS/CxVSWebService.asmx

<strong>Note</strong>: Don't forget to have a look over the WSDL to see what is the expected format and structure. If you wanna convert automatically all of the SOAP calls to Postman format, please have a look over my other project called "wsdl2postman": https://github.com/miguelfreitas93/wsdl2postman
